This software is a web platform built to make schedules for the students at Saint Louis University. Currently, students have to navigate multiple websites to determine what courses they are required to take and when. Our platform takes in data from SLUâ€™s roadmaps, course website, student personal information/goals, and creates a personalized schedule for each semester. Our goal is to focus on the student experience and make planning your college career significantly easier. Aside from just creating a set schedule from a roadmap, our platform takes in data from Rate My Professor and creates a schedule with not only the best timing but also the best professors. At the end of each semester, we will also give students an option to rate the professors they have just taken to decrease any discrepancies between the reviews on Rate My Professor. In short, it is more than just a course scheduler. It is a tool that combines academic planning with real student feedback, making the process both smarter and more personal. We also plan to include a Chatbot feature that will allow students to input their interests in jobs, topics, and specific classes, so all the schedules al tailored to their needs.
